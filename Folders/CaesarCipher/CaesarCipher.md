These two lines of code are responsible for encoding a single character of the input string using the Caesar cipher.

In the `first line`, if the character being encoded is an uppercase letter, the code converts it to its encoded form by adding the offset to the ASCII value of 'A' (65), then adding the difference between the ASCII value of the current uppercase letter and the ASCII value of 'A'. This calculates how many letters apart the current character is from 'A'. The result is then taken modulo 26 to ensure that the encoded character stays within the range of uppercase letters (A-Z). Finally, the resulting ASCII value is converted back to a character and appended to the StringBuilder encoded.

In the `second line`, if the character being encoded is a lowercase letter, the same process is followed, but with the ASCII value of 'a' (97) instead of 'A'. This ensures that the encoded character stays within the range of lowercase letters (a-z).

The modulo operation with 26 is used to wrap the encoded value around the alphabet. For example, if the offset is 2 and the letter being encoded is 'Y', then 'Y' has an ASCII value of 89. Adding the offset and 'A' results in 91, which is the ASCII value of '['. However, '[' is not a letter in the range A-Z, so the modulo operation with 26 is used to wrap the value around the alphabet, resulting in 'A' (ASCII value 65) as the encoded character. This ensures that the encoded character is always a letter in the range A-Z or a-z.
