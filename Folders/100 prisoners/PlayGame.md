Tell me how does this function works

Function<Integer, Boolean> play = p -> {
    // Generate a random number between 1 and 10.
    // The probability of the random number being less than or equal to p is p/10.
    int randomNum = (int) (Math.random() * 10) + 1;
    // Return true if the random number is less than or equal to p.
    return randomNum <= p;
};

```


This function, assigned to the variable play, takes an integer input p and returns a boolean value. Here's how it works:

A random integer between 1 and 10 is generated using the Math.random() method. This method returns a random double value between 0.0 and 1.0 (exclusive), so we multiply it by 10 to get a value between 0.0 and 10.0 (exclusive), and then cast it to an integer to get a value between 1 and 10 (inclusive).

We then calculate the probability of the random number being less than or equal to p. Since the random number has an equal chance of being any integer between 1 and 10, the probability of it being less than or equal to p is p/10. For example, if p is 5, then the probability of the random number being less than or equal to p is 5/10 or 0.5.

We compare the random number to p and return true if the random number is less than or equal to p, and false otherwise. If the random number is less than or equal to p, it means that the probability of the random number being less than or equal to p was greater than or equal to the actual probability of the random number, so we return true. Otherwise, we return false.
